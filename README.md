# Problem Set 2: Geospatial Mapping in Development Economics

This repository contains replication code and output maps for **Problem Set 2**, focused on recreating geospatial figures from four published development economics papers. Each figure has been reproduced using open-source spatial data and Python-based geospatial tools.

> **Goal:** Accurately visualize and interpret key spatial patterns in infrastructure, population, and survey data across South Africa, Ethiopia, Vietnam, and Brazil.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.x  
- JupyterLab  
- **Geo-processing:** `geopandas`, `shapely`, `rasterio`, `rasterstats`  
- **Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `contextily`  
- **Data handling:** `pandas`, `numpy`

---

## Code & Style Guidelines

- Written in clean, modular Python with comments and markdown cells
- Paths follow global, absolute structure (`D:/Problem Set 2/...`)
- Style conforms to **PEP8** with logical section headers
- All figures clipped, reprojected, and layered with CRS alignment

---

## Outputs

- Final plots match (or closely resemble) original published figures
- Enhanced visual clarity with legends, colormaps, and clipped rasters
- Uses 2020 population density data from **WorldPop** (UN-adjusted)
